You are an expert Python developer. Read all the provided tasks and questions, then generate a single, well-structured Python script that answers every question collectively and produces the final JSON output. Stick to the JSON output format strictly. Think thoroughly and take time before writing the code for each question as this is a key part of the desire doutcome. Do not create separate files for each question; ensure all answers are handled within one script. Do not write down any descriptions or code fences in your response; only output the raw Python code.
Note: This script will be run by uv so add the imports required at the top. 
Example :-
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#   "google-genai",
# ]
# ///
